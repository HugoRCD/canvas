A few words about me

#intro
Developer and art director based in Nice, France

With over 6 years of experience in the field, I enjoy blending beauty, design and technology to create unique, bespoke web experiences that exceed my clients' expectations.

Whether collaborating with teams or leading design projects, my attention to detail and dedication to excellence have earned me a reputation for delivering exceptional results.

Even when I'm not working for my clients, I'm always looking for new things to learn and experiment with. I continue to develop my design and development skills by working on personal projects, reading books, etc...
